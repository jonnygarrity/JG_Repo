  <h1>THAMES WATER WINTER CAMPAIGN</h1>

  <img class="top_image" src="assets/Regency_V2.png" />

  <p>Thames Water required a campaign for winter 2018, to be distributed both throughout London and across multiple digital channels. The objective of the campaign was to encourage homeowners to prepare their houses for the cold winter temperatures.</p>
  <p>The campaign which was selected adopted an upbeat tone with a focus on unique, colourful animation. Two separate video designs were created, warning of the possible consequences of being ill-prepared for winter.</p>
  <p>Thames Water loved the campaign, using it as a key part of their marketing throughout the winter months.</p>
