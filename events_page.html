  <h1>FAIRVIEW H2B EVENTS PAGE DESIGN</h1>

  <img class="top_image" src="assets/fairview_events_page_V2.png" />

  <p>Fairview New Homes required a unique, responsive desktop and mobile webpage for their Help To Buy roadshow event, whilst also showcasing two of their newest London developments.</p>
  <p>The site incorporated the H2B palette, as well as campaign-specific graphics to reinforce the impact of the event. The H2B module was individually designed to differentiate it from the other two, whilst the development sections were visual and concise and featured all relevant information.</p>
  <p>The client liked the design, introducing it for the duration of their 'Help To Buy Heroes' campaign, where it proved an effective educational and marketing page.</p>
