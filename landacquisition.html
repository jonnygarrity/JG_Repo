  <h1>MOBILE WEB OPTIMISATION</h1>

  <img class="top_image" src="assets/land_acquisition_V2.png" />

  <p>Fairview New Homes required their Land Acquisition webpage to be reconfigured into a mobile-friendly design, whilst keeping the assets and content order consistent to their existing desktop site.</p>
  <p>The resulting mobile website was one which related to the desktop site well, with a logical order and smooth user experience. The redesigned toolbar icons compliment the overall aesthetic of the interface and the updated order of the modules give the interface a natural flow.</p>
  <p>The client liked the new design, implementing it into their current web design for their Land Acquisition division.</p>
