  <h1>BURRINGTON ESTATES WEBSITE DESIGN</h1>

  <img class="top_image" src="assets/burrington_V2.png" />

  <p>Burrington Estates needed to update their website to a cleaner, less cluttered design, which was easier for users to navigate.</p>
  <p>The new site was one which utilised a new group of assets and modules, alongside a brighter aesthetic which benefitted from using smaller, less overpowering images. The redesigned static toolbar also aids navigation, due to the less cluttered layout, whilst the centralisation of the Burrington logo adds a sense of symmetry.</p>
  <p>Burrington Estates loved the new site and approved it to be built straight away, with the launch being planned for May 2019.</p>
