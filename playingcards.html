  <h1>SELLING YACHTS WITH PLAYING CARDS</h1>

  <img class="top_image" src="assets/FALLING_CARDS.png" />
  <p>Fairline Yachts needed to set themselves apart from the competition in the luxury yacht market. Here, a marketing tool was created, something which Fairline could take to boat shows, give to clients and subtly remind them of the company’s brand values.</p>

  <p>A set of playing cards was designed, with close attention to detail on the fronts and backs of the cards. Strategically-placed spot UV, along with silver foiling, draw the eye to the most important sections of the cards, whilst improving the overall user experience. The resulting suits were inspired by Fairline’s four brand pillars, and the final card aesthetics were reflective of Fairline’s brand image.</p>

  <p>The client loved the playing card concept and planned to put the concept into production in time for the next boat show, as a gift for all their visitors and customers. </p>
