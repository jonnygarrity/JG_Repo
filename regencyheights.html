  <h1>REGENCY HEIGHTS MOBILE SITE</h1>

  <img class="top_image" src="assets/Regency_V2.png" />

  <p>Fairview New Homes needed a reconfiguration of their Regency Heights development site to optimise the mobile viewing experience.</p>
  <p>The resulting mobile website kept the existing assets and mirrored the layout of the original website whilst incorporating a more user-friendly browsing experience. The newly designed menu icons are clear and concise, whilst meeting the criteria set to the client, as the page was to be operated both in English and Chinese.</p>
  <p>Fairview approved of the mobile site design, incorporating it into their marketing for the Regency Heights development in London.</p>
